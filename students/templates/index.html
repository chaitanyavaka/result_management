    <h3 class="side-heading">Founders and Directors</h3>
    <h4>St.Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society Of Jesus, was born in 1491 as the last child of a large Basque family of Spain. The name 'Loyola' came from the ancestral castle that was the family heritage of St.Ignatius. He recorded his experiences in a book called “ The Spiritual Exercises” which became the soul and center, the rule and character of every Jesuit who came thereafter.</h4>
